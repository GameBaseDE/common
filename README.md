# CI Configuration
This project contains `.gitlab-ci.yml` that can be imported commonly by all projects.
The advantage of this is that you don't need to setup everything by your own. Also, we may have something like a norm e. g. for Docker deployments. In case something changes there, you don't need to take care of it.
